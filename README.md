## __Cosadama 코사다마__

*The best way to do something is to do with someone to produce something.*

Cosadama is the programming boot camp by sociology students of Chung-Ang university, Seoul, Korea. The group name "Cosadama" comes from the compound of  "CODING", __"사회학(sociology)"__ which sounds 'sa-hui-hak' and **"好事多魔"** which is a proverb meaning that you need to hard work to go right way and sounds 'ho-sa-da-ma'. The name means that we all finally go right way(maybe could be top programmer) after taking all the struggles, such as endless errors, back-ache etc. Then, Look forward to what we are! Love you all from sociology dept.
